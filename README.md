## Online Store made with React

This was a group project developed in the [Software Development Course at Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/formacao-desenvolvimento-web). In this project we were able to catch products from [Mercado Libre API](https://developers.mercadolivre.com.br/pt_br/itens-e-buscas) and show them to the users. We also made a page so users could make a review of a product, the users also could add products on a shopping cart. Made on ```August 17th, 2021```
